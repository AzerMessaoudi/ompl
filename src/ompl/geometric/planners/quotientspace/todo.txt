FB
[x] Clean up constructor Bundle Space
[x] Organize MultiQuotient classes in better way
[x] Add QRRTStar
[x] Clean up QMPStar, make it inherit from QMP
[x] Make Bundle/Base/Fiber private, so that we have to use custom in-built
interpolate/distance/addConfiguration methods. (then we can easily add dynamical
constraints there, usable by any bundle algorithm)
[x] Move Explorer stuff from GraphSparse to Explorer
[x] Move pathVisibilityChecker to Explorer
[x] Move SPQR checks to GraphSparse
[x] make QMPStar inherit from QMP
[x] Run Benchmark Rapid Inf Test
[ ] rewrite diagram to go top down (including little squares)
[ ] handle NH constraints in QMPStar and SPQR
[ ] Add Types for Metric/Importance/Sampler
[ ] Implement Random-Degree-Vertex sampling

Improvements (FB):
- multi robot implementation using a new component-based implementation
- enabled non-holonomic planning on bundles
- additional bundles (empty, relaxed, etc)
- Four new algorithms: QRRT*, QMP, QMP*, SPQR
- Sparse graph structures (based on SPARS impl)
- Enabled different metrics
- Enabled different graph sampler
- Enabled different propagators
- Enabled different selector functions for multiple bundles

MT
[ ] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer
[ ] Incorporate optimizer
[ ] Return control in PlannerData
