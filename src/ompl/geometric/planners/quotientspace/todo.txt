[x] Clean up constructor Bundle Space
[x] Organize MultiQuotient classes in better way
[x] Add QRRTStar
[x] Clean up QMPStar, make it inherit from QMP
[x] Make Bundle/Base/Fiber private, so that we have to use custom in-built
interpolate/distance/addConfiguration methods. (then we can easily add dynamical
constraints there, usable by any bundle algorithm)
[x] Move Explorer stuff from GraphSparse to Explorer
[x] Move pathVisibilityChecker to Explorer
[x] Move SPQR checks to GraphSparse
[x] make QMPStar inherit from QMP
[x] Run Benchmark Rapid Inf Test
[x] rewrite diagram to go top down (including little squares)
[x] Implement Random-Degree-Vertex sampling
[x] prettify diagram
[x] Refactor IdentifyBundleSpaceComponentType
[x] Fix memory leak on shortest path metric
[x] Add Adaptive Graph Thickening
[x] Add last Valid sampling bias after we tried a geodesic lift
[x] Add SO3xRN

[ ] *** Add steering function support (at least SE3 and SE2)
[ ] ** Clarify experiments
[ ] * handle NH constraints in QMPStar and SPQR
[ ] * Add Enumerate for Metric/Importance/Sampler (Options Class?)
[ ] * Make path segment sampling more robust
[ ] * benchmark the whole suite on pregrasp
[ ] ** Merge with master branch ompl/ompl (to get newest planner versions)

Improvements (FB):
- Enable Multi Robot Planning using a new component-based implementation
- Clean up quotient-space code using new fiber bundle notation
- Enable handling of non-holonomic constraints
- Add new bundle spaces (empty, relaxed, identity, SO2xRN)
- Add algorithms: QRRT*, QMP, QMP*, SPQR
- Add sparse graph structures (based on SPARS impl)
- Enable different bundle metrics
- Enable different bundle graph sampler
- Enable different propagators
- Enable different selector functions for multiple bundles
