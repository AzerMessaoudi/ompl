[x] Clean up constructor Bundle Space
[x] Organize MultiQuotient classes in better way
[x] Add QRRTStar
[x] Clean up QMPStar, make it inherit from QMP
[ ] Make Bundle/Base/Fiber private, so that we have to use custom in-built
interpolate/distance/addConfiguration methods. (then we can easily add dynamical
constraints there, usable by any bundle algorithm)
[ ] render GL output?

MT
[ ] Clean up Bundle Space Graph Sparse (outsource explorer functions)
[ ] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer
[ ] Incorporate optimizer
[ ] Return control in PlannerData
