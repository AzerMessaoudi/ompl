[x] Clean up constructor Bundle Space
[x] Organize MultiQuotient classes in better way
[x] Add QRRTStar
[x] Clean up QMPStar, make it inherit from QMP
[x] Make Bundle/Base/Fiber private, so that we have to use custom in-built
interpolate/distance/addConfiguration methods. (then we can easily add dynamical
constraints there, usable by any bundle algorithm)
[x] Move Explorer stuff from GraphSparse to Explorer
[x] Move pathVisibilityChecker to Explorer
[x] Move SPQR checks to GraphSparse
[x] make QMPStar inherit from QMP
[x] Run Benchmark Rapid Inf Test
[x] rewrite diagram to go top down (including little squares)
[x] Implement Random-Degree-Vertex sampling
[x] prettify diagram
[x] Refactor IdentifyBundleSpaceComponentType
[x] Fix memory leak on shortest path metric
[x] Add Adaptive Graph Thickening
[x] Add last Valid sampling bias after we tried a geodesic lift
[x] Add SO3xRN
[x] Merge with master branch ompl/ompl (to get newest planner versions)
[x] benchmark the whole suite on pregrasp
[x] Fix base space Nan values in hypercube benchmark
[x] Rename LiftPath to InterpolateAlongPathSection
[x] Try to fix path section interpolation by using random fiber directions
(particle shooting extension?)
[x] Fix Hypercube out_of_range error
[x] Add L1 interpolation on restriction into recursiverepair (for QRRT,
verify on Hypercube)
[x] Outsource path section shooting method to own folder
[x] Rename quotientspace folder to multilevel (when we migrated to final ompl
merge branch) 
[x] *** Add inverse L1 and extend box scenario

[ ] *** Make L1+L2 combined recursiverepair section method
[ ] ** Make path bias a dynamic window (test SE3 and SE3^k)

[ ] * Refactor path section to allow steering methods (path restriction w NH
cnstrs)
[ ] *** Add steering function support (at least SE3 and SE2)
[ ] * What to do about velocity constraints?

[ ] * Make bidirectional version of QRRT (as param)
[ ] * Make path sections as strategy pattern inside a pathrestriction. Do the same
for graphs
[ ] Remove DenseGraphPath method from BundleSpaceGraph.h
[ ] * Add Enumerate for Metric/Importance/Sampler (Use Params like in RRTstar)
[ ] ** Plot hypercube benchmark (fix log to plot script)
[ ] * handle NH constraints in QMPStar and SPQR
[ ] **merge* Make sure every experiment is solvable in "realtime" (around 3s)
[ ] Rename whole repo
[ ] Write novel tutorial/demo (after paper is out)

[ ] Remove all sanitychecks/debug informations

- Add algorithms: QRRT*, QMP, QMP*, SPQR
- Add sparse graph structures (based on SPARS impl)
- Add new path restriction/section method (see paper)
- Enable different bundle metrics
- Enable different bundle graph sampler
